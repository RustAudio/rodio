//! Noise sources for audio synthesis and testing.
//!
//! ## Available Noise Types
//!
//! | **Noise Type**       | **Best For**                                            | **Sound Character**                 | **Technical Notes**                              |
//! |----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
//! | **White noise**      | Testing equipment linearly, masking sounds              | Harsh, static-like, evenly bright   | RPDF (uniform), equal power all frequencies      |
//! | **Gaussian white**   | Scientific modeling, natural processes                  | Similar to white but more natural   | GPDF (bell curve), better statistical properties |
//! | **Triangular white** | High-quality audio dithering                            | Similar to white noise              | TPDF, eliminates quantization correlation        |
//! | **Pink noise**       | Speaker testing, calibration, background sounds         | Warm, pleasant, like rainfall       | 1/f spectrum, matches human hearing              |
//! | **Blue noise**       | High-passed dithering, reducing low-frequency artifacts | Bright but smoother than white      | High-pass filtered white, less harsh             |
//! | **Violet noise**     | Testing high frequencies, harsh effects                 | Very bright, sharp, can be piercing | Heavy high-frequency emphasis                    |
//! | **Brownian noise**   | Muffled/distant effects, deep rumbles                   | Very deep, muffled, lacks highs     | Heavy low-frequency emphasis, ~5Hz cutoff        |
//! | **Velvet noise**     | Artificial reverb, room simulation                      | Sparse random impulses              | Computationally efficient, decorrelated          |
//!
//! ## Seeking Support
//!
//! **Seekable generators** (stateless or can reset state):
//! - White, Gaussian white, Triangular white noise (stateless)
//! - Violet noise (can reset differentiator state)
//!
//! **Non-seekable generators** (stateful - depends on previous samples):
//! - Pink (integrator state), Blue (depends on pink)
//! - Brownian (accumulator state), Velvet (grid position state)
//!
//! ## Basic Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use rodio::source::noise::{WhiteUniform, Pink, WhiteTriangular, Blue};
//!
//! // Simple usage - creates generators with `SmallRng`
//! let white = WhiteUniform::new(44100);          // For testing equipment linearly
//! let pink = Pink::new(44100);                   // For pleasant background sound
//! let triangular = WhiteTriangular::new(44100);  // For TPDF dithering
//! let blue = Blue::new(44100);                   // For high-passed dithering applications
//!
//! // Advanced usage - specify your own RNG type
//! use rand::{rngs::StdRng, SeedableRng};
//! let white_custom = WhiteUniform::<StdRng>::new_with_rng(44100, StdRng::seed_from_u64(12345));
//! ```
