# Announcing rodio 0.21


Rodio is an audio playback library. It can decode audio files, synthesize new
sounds, apply effects to sounds & mix them. Rodio has been part of the Rust
ecosystem for 9 years now! ðŸŽ‰.

## New release
Its been 5 months since our last release. Since the our team has grown to 3
maintainers! Thank you Petr and Roderick! And a big thanks for the countless
other contributors helping out. Thanks to them this release:

- Makes the API easier to use
    - Its now impossible to accidentally drop the `Outputstream`.
    - Our types are no longer generic over sample type.
- The decoders have been improved enabling *gapless* playback and offering many
  configuration options through a new builder.
- You can use rodio without `cpal` to generate `wav` files! 

There have also been many fixes and smaller additions, take a look at the
[changelog](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/blob/89dac52/CHANGELOG.md)!

## The future
We keep working on easy audio playback. We hope to announce something new soon!
