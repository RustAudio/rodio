//! Audio peak limiting for dynamic range control.
//!
//! This module implements a feedforward limiter that prevents audio peaks from exceeding
//! a specified threshold while maintaining audio quality. The limiter is based on:
//! Giannoulis, D., Massberg, M., & Reiss, J.D. (2012). Digital Dynamic Range Compressor Design,
//! A Tutorial and Analysis. Journal of The Audio Engineering Society, 60, 399-408.
//!
//! # What is Limiting?
//!
//! A limiter reduces the amplitude of audio signals that exceed a threshold level.
//! For example, with a -6dB threshold, peaks above that level are reduced to stay near the
//! threshold, preventing clipping and maintaining consistent output levels.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * **Soft-knee limiting** - Gradual transition into limiting for natural sound
//! * **Per-channel detection** - Decoupled peak detection per channel
//! * **Coupled gain reduction** - Uniform gain reduction across channels preserves stereo imaging
//! * **Configurable timing** - Adjustable attack/release times for different use cases
//! * **Efficient processing** - Optimized implementations for mono, stereo, and multi-channel audio
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Use [`LimitSettings`] to configure the limiter, then apply it to any audio source:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use rodio::source::{SineWave, Source, LimitSettings};
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! // Create a loud sine wave
//! let source = SineWave::new(440.0).amplify(2.0);
//!
//! // Apply limiting with -6dB threshold
//! let settings = LimitSettings::default().with_threshold(-6.0);
//! let limited = source.limit(settings);
//! ```
//!
//! # Presets
//!
//! [`LimitSettings`] provides optimized presets for common use cases:
//!
//! * [`LimitSettings::default()`] - General-purpose limiting (-1 dBFS, balanced)
//! * [`LimitSettings::dynamic_content()`] - Music and sound effects (-3 dBFS, transparent)
//! * [`LimitSettings::broadcast()`] - Streaming and voice chat (fast response, consistent)
//! * [`LimitSettings::mastering()`] - Final production stage (-0.5 dBFS, tight peak control)
//! * [`LimitSettings::gaming()`] - Interactive audio (-3 dBFS, responsive dynamics)
//! * [`LimitSettings::live_performance()`] - Real-time applications (ultra-fast protection)
//!
//! ```rust
//! use rodio::source::{SineWave, Source, LimitSettings};
//!
//! // Use preset optimized for music
//! let music = SineWave::new(440.0).amplify(1.5);
//! let limited_music = music.limit(LimitSettings::dynamic_content());
//!
//! // Use preset optimized for streaming
//! let stream = SineWave::new(440.0).amplify(2.0);
//! let limited_stream = stream.limit(LimitSettings::broadcast());
//! ```

/// Configuration settings for audio limiting.
///
/// This struct defines how the limiter behaves, including when to start limiting
/// (threshold), how gradually to apply it (knee width), and how quickly to respond
/// to level changes (attack/release times).
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * **Threshold** - Level in dB where limiting begins (must be negative, typically -1 to -6 dB)
/// * **Knee Width** - Range in dB over which limiting gradually increases (wider = smoother)
/// * **Attack** - Time to respond to level increases (shorter = faster but may distort)
/// * **Release** - Time to recover after level decreases (longer = smoother)
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Basic Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// use rodio::source::{SineWave, Source, LimitSettings};
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// // Use default settings (-1 dB threshold, 4 dB knee, 5ms attack, 100ms release)
/// let source = SineWave::new(440.0).amplify(2.0);
/// let limited = source.limit(LimitSettings::default());
/// ```
///
/// ## Custom Settings with Builder Pattern
///
/// ```rust
/// use rodio::source::{SineWave, Source, LimitSettings};
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// let source = SineWave::new(440.0).amplify(3.0);
/// let settings = LimitSettings::new()
///     .with_threshold(-6.0)                    // Limit peaks above -6dB
///     .with_knee_width(2.0)                    // 2dB soft knee for smooth limiting
///     .with_attack(Duration::from_millis(3))   // Fast 3ms attack
///     .with_release(Duration::from_millis(50)); // 50ms release
///
/// let limited = source.limit(settings);
/// ```
///
/// ## Common Adjustments
///
/// ```rust
/// use rodio::source::LimitSettings;
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// // More headroom for dynamic content
/// let conservative = LimitSettings::default()
///     .with_threshold(-3.0)                    // More headroom
///     .with_knee_width(6.0);                   // Wide knee for transparency
///
/// // Tighter control for broadcast/streaming
/// let broadcast = LimitSettings::default()
///     .with_knee_width(2.0)                     // Narrower knee for firmer limiting
///     .with_attack(Duration::from_millis(3))    // Faster attack
///     .with_release(Duration::from_millis(50)); // Faster release
/// ```

/// # dB vs. dBFS Reference
///
/// This limiter uses **dBFS (decibels relative to Full Scale)** for all level measurements:
/// - **0 dBFS** = maximum possible digital level (1.0 in linear scale)
/// - **Negative dBFS** = levels below maximum (e.g., -6 dBFS = 0.5 in linear scale)
/// - **Positive dBFS** = levels above maximum (causes digital clipping)
///
/// Unlike absolute dB measurements (dB SPL), dBFS is relative to the digital system's
/// maximum representable value, making it the standard for digital audio processing.
///
/// ## Common dBFS Reference Points
/// - **0 dBFS**: Digital maximum (clipping threshold)
/// - **-1 dBFS**: Just below clipping (tight limiting)
/// - **-3 dBFS**: Moderate headroom (balanced limiting)
/// - **-6 dBFS**: Generous headroom (gentle limiting)
/// - **-12 dBFS**: Conservative level (preserves significant dynamics)
/// - **-20 dBFS**: Very quiet level (background/ambient sounds)

/// This filter reduces the amplitude of audio signals that exceed the configured threshold

/// appropriate internal implementation.
///
/// # How It Works
///
/// The limiter detects peaks in each audio channel independently but applies gain reduction
/// uniformly across all channels. This preserves stereo imaging while ensuring that loud
/// peaks in any channel are controlled. The limiting uses:
///
/// - **Soft-knee compression**: Gradual gain reduction around the threshold
/// - **Attack/release timing**: Configurable response speed to level changes
/// - **Peak detection**: Tracks maximum levels across all channels
/// - **Gain smoothing**: Prevents audible artifacts from rapid gain changes
///
/// # Created By
///
/// Use [`Source::limit()`] with [`LimitSettings`] to create a `Limit` source:
///
/// ```
/// use rodio::source::{SineWave, Source};
/// use rodio::source::LimitSettings;
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// let source = SineWave::new(440.0).amplify(2.0);
/// let settings = LimitSettings::default()
///     .with_threshold(-6.0)  // -6 dBFS threshold
///     .with_attack(Duration::from_millis(5))
///     .with_release(Duration::from_millis(100));
/// let limited = source.limit(settings);
/// ```
///
/// # Performance
///
/// The limiter automatically selects the most efficient implementation based on channel count:
/// - **Mono**: Single-channel optimized processing
/// - **Stereo**: Two-channel optimized with interleaved processing
/// - **Multi-channel**: Generic implementation for 3+ channels
///
/// # Channel Count Stability
///
/// **Important**: The limiter is optimized for sources with fixed channel counts.
/// Most audio files (music, podcasts, etc.) maintain constant channel counts,
/// making this optimization safe and beneficial.
///
/// If the underlying source changes channel count mid-stream (rare), the limiter
/// will continue to function but performance may be degraded. For such cases,
/// recreate the limiter when the channel count changes.
///
/// # Type Parameters
