/// A source of samples.
///
/// # A quick lesson about sounds
///
/// ## Sampling
///
/// A sound is a vibration that propagates through air and reaches your ears. This vibration can
/// be represented as an analog signal.
///
/// In order to store this signal in the computer's memory or on the disk, we perform what is
/// called *sampling*. The consists in choosing an interval of time (for example 20µs) and reading
/// the amplitude of the signal at each interval (for example, if the interval is 20µs we read the
/// amplitude every 20µs). By doing so we obtain a list of numerical values, each value being
/// called a *sample*.
///
/// Therefore, a sound can be represented in memory by a frequency and a list of samples. The
/// frequency is expressed in hertz and corresponds to the number of samples that have been
/// read per second. For example if we read one sample every 20µs, the frequency would be
/// 50000 Hz. In reality, common values for the frequency are 44100, 48000 and 96000.
///
/// ## Channels
///
/// But a frequency and a list of values only represent one signal. When you listen to a sound,
/// your left and right ears don't receive exactly the same signal. In order to handle this,
/// we usually record not one but two different signals: one for the left ear and one for the right
/// ear. We say that such a sound has two *channels*.
///
/// Sometimes sounds even have five or six channels, each corresponding to a location around the
/// head of the listener.
///
/// The standard in audio manipulation is to *interleave* the multiple channels. In other words,
/// in a sound with two channels the list of samples contains the first sample of the first
/// channel, then the first sample of the second channel, then the second sample of the first
/// channel, then the second sample of the second channel, and so on. The same applies if you have
/// more than two channels. The rodio library only supports this schema.
///
/// Therefore, in order to represent a sound in memory in fact we need three characteristics: the
/// frequency, the number of channels, and the list of samples.
///
/// ## The `Source` trait
///
/// A Rust object that represents a sound should implement the `Source` trait.
///
/// The three characteristics that describe a sound are provided through this trait:
///
/// - The number of channels can be retrieved with `channels`.
/// - The frequency can be retrieved with `sample_rate`.
/// - The list of values can be retrieved by iterating on the source. The `Source` trait requires
///   that the `Iterator` trait be implemented as well. When a `Source` returns None the
///   sound has ended.
///
/// # Frames
///
/// The samples rate and number of channels of some sound sources can change by itself from time
/// to time.
///
/// > **Note**: As a basic example, if you play two audio files one after the other and treat the
/// > whole as a single source, then the channels and samples rate of that source may change at the
/// > transition between the two files.
///
/// However, for optimization purposes rodio supposes that the number of channels and the frequency
/// stay the same for long periods of time and avoids calling `channels()` and
/// `sample_rate` too frequently.
///
/// In order to properly handle this situation, the `current_frame_len()` method should return
/// the number of samples that remain in the iterator before the samples rate and number of
/// channels can potentially change.
///

    ///   The desired output level, where 1.0 represents the original sound level.

    ///   will aim to increase the gain by a factor of 1.4, resulting in a minimum 40% amplification.
    ///   A recommended level is `1.0`, which maintains the original sound level.
    ///
    /// `attack_time`:
    ///   **TL;DR**: Response time for volume increases. Shorter = faster but may cause abrupt changes. **Recommended: `4.0` seconds**.
    ///
    ///   The time (in seconds) for the AGC to respond to input level increases.
    ///   Shorter times mean faster response but may cause abrupt changes. Longer times result
    ///   in smoother transitions but slower reactions to sudden volume changes. Too short can
    ///   lead to overreaction to peaks, causing unnecessary adjustments. Too long can make the
    ///   AGC miss important volume changes or react too slowly to sudden loud passages. Very
    ///   high values might result in excessively loud output or sluggish response, as the AGC's
    ///   adjustment speed is limited by the attack time. Balance is key for optimal performance.
    ///   A recommended attack_time of `4.0` seconds provides a sweet spot for most applications.
    ///
    /// `release_time`:
    ///   **TL;DR**: Response time for volume decreases. Shorter = faster gain reduction. **Recommended: `0.005` seconds**.
    ///
    ///   The time (in seconds) for the AGC to respond to input level decreases.
    ///   This parameter controls how quickly the gain is reduced when the signal level drops.
    ///   Shorter release times result in faster gain reduction, which can be useful for quick
    ///   adaptation to quieter passages but may lead to pumping effects. Longer release times
    ///   provide smoother transitions but may be slower to respond to sudden decreases in volume.
    ///   However, if the release_time is too high, the AGC may not be able to lower the gain
    ///   quickly enough, potentially leading to clipping and distorted sound before it can adjust.
    ///   Finding the right balance is crucial for maintaining natural-sounding dynamics and
    ///   preventing distortion. A recommended release_time of `0.005` seconds often works well for
    ///   general use, providing a good balance between responsiveness and smooth transitions.
    ///
    /// `absolute_max_gain`:
    ///   **TL;DR**: Maximum allowed gain. Prevents over-amplification. **Recommended: `5.0`**.
    ///
    ///   The maximum gain that can be applied to the signal.
    ///   This parameter acts as a safeguard against excessive amplification of quiet signals
    ///   or background noise. It establishes an upper boundary for the AGC's signal boost,
    ///   effectively preventing distortion or overamplification of low-level sounds.
    ///   This is crucial for maintaining audio quality and preventing unexpected volume spikes.
    ///   A recommended value for `absolute_max_gain` is `5`, which provides a good balance between
    ///   amplification capability and protection against distortion in most scenarios.
    ///
