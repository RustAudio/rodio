//! Noise sources for audio synthesis and testing.
//!
//! ## Available Noise Types
//!
//! | **Noise Type** | **Best For** | **Sound Character** | **Technical Notes* |
//! |----------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|
//! | **White noise** | Testing equipment linearly, masking sounds | Harsh, static-like, evenly bright | RPDF (uniform), equal power all frequencies |
//! | **Gaussian white** | Scientific modeling, natural processes | Similar to white but more natural | GPDF (bell curve), better statistical properties |
//! | **Triangular white** | High-quality audio dithering | Similar to white noise | TPDF, eliminates quantization correlation |
//! | **Pink noise** | Speaker testing, calibration, background sounds | Warm, pleasant, like rainfall | 1/f spectrum, matches human hearing |
//! | **Blue noise** | High-passed dithering, reducing low-frequency artifacts | Bright but smoother than white | High-pass filtered white, less harsh |
//! | **Violet noise** | Testing high frequencies, harsh effects | Very bright, sharp, can be piercing | Heavy high-frequency emphasis |
//! | **Brownian noise** | Scientific modeling of Brownian motion | Very deep, muffled, lacks highs | True stochastic process, Gaussian increments |
//! | **Red noise** | Practical deep/muffled effects, distant rumbles | Very deep, muffled, lacks highs | 1/f² spectrum, uniform input |
//! | **Velvet noise** | Artificial reverb, room simulation | Sparse random impulses | Computationally efficient, decorrelated |
//!
//! ## Basic Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::num::NonZero;
//! use rodio::source::noise::{WhiteUniform, Pink, WhiteTriangular, Blue, Red};
//! use rodio::SampleRate;
//!
//! let sample_rate = NonZero::new(44100).unwrap();
//!
//! // Simple usage - creates generators with `SmallRng`
//!
//! // For testing equipment linearly
//! let white = WhiteUniform::new(sample_rate);
//! // For pleasant background sound
//! let pink = Pink::new(sample_rate);
//! // For TPDF dithering
//! let triangular = WhiteTriangular::new(sample_rate);
//! // For high-passed dithering applications
//! let blue = Blue::new(sample_rate);
//! // For practical deep/muffled effects
//! let red = Red::new(sample_rate);
//!
//! // Advanced usage - specify your own RNG type
//! use rand::{rngs::StdRng, SeedableRng};
//! let white_custom = WhiteUniform::<StdRng>::new_with_rng(sample_rate, StdRng::seed_from_u64(12345));
