//! FLAC audio decoder implementation.
//!
//! This module provides FLAC decoding capabilities using the `claxon` library. The FLAC format
//! is a lossless audio compression format that preserves original audio data while reducing file
//! size through sophisticated entropy coding and decorrelation techniques.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **Bit depths**: Full support for 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32-bit audio
//! - **Sample rates**: Supports all FLAC-compatible sample rates (1Hz to 655,350Hz)
//! - **Channels**: Supports mono, stereo, and multi-channel audio (up to 8 channels)
//! - **Seeking**: Full forward and backward seeking with sample-accurate positioning
//! - **Duration**: Accurate total duration calculation from stream metadata
//! - **Performance**: Optimized block-based decoding with reusable buffers
//!
//! # Advantages
//!
//! - **Perfect quality**: Lossless compression preserves original audio fidelity
//! - **Efficient compression**: Typically 30-50% size reduction vs. uncompressed
//! - **Fast decoding**: Optimized algorithms with minimal computational overhead
//! - **Precise seeking**: Sample-accurate positioning without approximation
//! - **Rich metadata**: Comprehensive format specification with extensive metadata support
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! - Seeking requires `is_seekable` setting for backward seeks (forward-only otherwise)
//! - No support for embedded cue sheets or complex metadata (focus on audio data)
//! - Larger files than lossy formats (trade-off for perfect quality)
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! The decoder can be configured through `DecoderBuilder`:
//! - `with_seekable(true)` - Enable backward seeking (recommended for FLAC)
//! - Other settings are informational and don't affect FLAC decoding performance
//!
//! # Performance Notes
//!
//! - Block-based decoding minimizes memory allocations during playback
//! - Seeking operations use efficient linear scanning or stream reset
//! - Buffer reuse optimizes performance for continuous playback
//! - Metadata parsing optimized for audio-focused applications
//! - Memory usage scales with maximum block size, not file size
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use rodio::Decoder;
//!
//! let file = File::open("audio.flac").unwrap();
//! let decoder = Decoder::builder()
//!     .with_data(file)
//!     .with_seekable(true)
//!     .build()
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//! // FLAC supports seeking and bit depth detection
//! println!("Bit depth: {:?}", decoder.bits_per_sample());
//! println!("Duration: {:?}", decoder.total_duration());
//! println!("Sample rate: {}", decoder.sample_rate().get());
//! ```
