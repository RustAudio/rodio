//! MP3 audio decoder implementation.
//!
//! This module provides MP3 decoding capabilities using the `minimp3` library. MP3 is a
//! lossy audio compression format that achieves smaller file sizes by removing audio
//! information that is less audible to human hearing.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **MPEG layers**: Supports MPEG-1/2 Layer III (MP3)
//! - **Bitrates**: Variable and constant bitrate encoding (32-320 kbps)
//! - **Sample rates**: 8kHz to 48kHz (MPEG-1: 32/44.1/48kHz, MPEG-2: 16/22.05/24kHz)
//! - **Channels**: Mono, stereo, joint stereo, and dual channel
//! - **Seeking**: Coarse seeking with optional duration scanning
//! - **Duration**: Calculated via file scanning or metadata when available
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! - No bit depth detection (lossy format with dynamic range compression)
//! - Seeking accuracy depends on bitrate variability (VBR vs CBR)
//! - Forward-only seeking without `is_seekable` setting
//! - Duration scanning requires full file analysis for accuracy
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! The decoder can be configured through `DecoderBuilder`:
//! - `with_seekable(true)` - Enable backward seeking
//! - `with_scan_duration(true)` - Enable duration scanning (requires `byte_len`)
//! - `with_total_duration(dur)` - Provide known duration to skip scanning
//! - `with_seek_mode(SeekMode::Fastest)` - Use fastest seeking method
//!
//! # Performance Notes
//!
//! - Duration scanning can be slow for large files
//! - Variable bitrate files may have less accurate seeking
//! - Frame-based decoding minimizes memory usage
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use rodio::Decoder;
//!
//! let file = File::open("audio.mp3").unwrap();
//! let decoder = Decoder::builder()
//!     .with_data(file)
//!     .with_seekable(true)
//!     .with_scan_duration(true)
//!     .build()
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//! // MP3 format doesn't support bit depth detection
//! assert_eq!(decoder.bits_per_sample(), None);
//! ```

/// Decoder for the MP3 format using the `minimp3` library.
///
/// Provides lossy audio decoding with frame-based processing and coarse seeking support.
/// Duration calculation may require file scanning for accurate results with variable bitrate files.
///
/// # Frame-based Processing
///
/// MP3 audio is organized into variable-size frames containing compressed audio data.
/// Each frame is decoded independently, containing 384 (Layer I) or 1152 (Layer II/III)
/// samples per channel. The decoder maintains the current frame and tracks position
/// within it for efficient sample-by-sample iteration.
///
/// # Seeking Behavior
///
/// MP3 seeking accuracy depends on the encoding type:
/// - **Constant Bitrate (CBR)**: Accurate byte-position-based seeking
/// - **Variable Bitrate (VBR)**: Approximate seeking with potential drift
/// - **Average Bitrate (ABR)**: Moderate accuracy depending on variation
///
/// # Bitrate Adaptation
///
/// The decoder tracks average bitrate over time to improve seeking accuracy,
/// especially for VBR files where initial estimates may be inaccurate.
///
/// # Channel Changes
///
/// MP3 frames can theoretically change channel configuration, though this is
/// rare in practice. The decoder handles such changes dynamically.
///
/// # Generic Parameters

/// * `data` - Mutable reference to the input stream to analyze

/// # Returns
///
/// - `Some(duration)` if the file was successfully analyzed
/// - `None` if scanning failed or the file is invalid
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Performance varies significantly based on available metadata:
/// - **With headers (XING/VBRI/INFO)**: Very fast, O(1) header lookup
/// - **Without headers**: Slower, O(n) frame-by-frame scanning proportional to file size
/// - **Large VBR files without headers**: Can take several seconds to analyze

/// # Implementation
///
/// The function:
/// 1. Saves the current stream position
/// 2. Rewinds to the beginning for analysis
/// 3. Uses `mp3-duration` crate which:
///    - First searches for XING, VBRI, or INFO headers containing duration
///    - Falls back to frame-by-frame scanning if no headers found
/// 4. Restores the original stream position
/// 5. Returns the calculated duration
///
/// # Accuracy
///
/// - **With metadata headers**: Exact duration from encoder-provided information
/// - **Frame scanning**: Sample-accurate duration from analyzing every frame

/// Both methods provide reliable duration information, with headers being faster.
