//! WAV audio decoder implementation.
//!
//! This module provides WAV decoding capabilities using the `hound` library. WAV is an
//! uncompressed audio format that stores PCM audio data with various bit depths and sample rates.
//! The format uses the RIFF (Resource Interchange File Format) container with WAVE chunks
//! containing audio metadata and raw PCM samples.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **Bit depths**: Full support for 8, 16, 24, and 32-bit integer PCM plus 32-bit float
//! - **Sample rates**: Supports all WAV-compatible sample rates (typically 8kHz to 192kHz)
//! - **Channels**: Supports mono, stereo, and multi-channel audio up to system limits
//! - **Seeking**: Fast random access seeking with sample-accurate positioning
//! - **Duration**: Instant duration calculation from WAV header information
//! - **Performance**: Direct sample access with optimized buffering and no decompression
//!
//! # Advantages
//!
//! - **Zero latency**: No compression/decompression overhead
//! - **Perfect quality**: Lossless storage preserves original audio fidelity
//! - **Fast seeking**: Direct sample access without stream scanning
//! - **Simple format**: Reliable parsing with well-defined structure
//! - **Universal support**: Widely supported across all audio applications
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! - No support for compressed WAV variants (ADPCM, Î¼-law, A-law, etc.)
//! - Forward-only seeking without `is_seekable` setting
//! - Limited to 32-bit sample indexing (4.2 billion samples max)
//! - Large file sizes due to uncompressed storage
//! - No embedded metadata beyond basic audio parameters
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! The decoder can be configured through `DecoderBuilder`:
//! - `with_seekable(true)` - Enable random access seeking (recommended for WAV)
//! - Other settings are informational and don't affect WAV decoding performance
//!
//! # Performance Notes
//!
//! - Header parsing is extremely fast (single read operation)
//! - No buffering overhead - samples read directly from file
//! - Seeking operations have O(1) complexity via direct file positioning
//! - Memory usage scales only with iterator state, not file size
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use rodio::Decoder;
//!
//! let file = File::open("audio.wav").unwrap();
//! let decoder = Decoder::builder()
//!     .with_data(file)
//!     .with_seekable(true)
//!     .build()
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//! // WAV supports seeking and bit depth detection
//! println!("Bit depth: {:?}", decoder.bits_per_sample());
//! println!("Duration: {:?}", decoder.total_duration());
//! println!("Sample rate: {}", decoder.sample_rate().get());
//! ```

/// Decoder for the WAV format using the `hound` library.
///
/// This decoder provides uncompressed PCM audio decoding with fast seeking and instant
/// duration calculation. WAV files contain header information that enables immediate
/// access to format parameters and file length without requiring stream analysis.
///
/// # RIFF/WAVE Structure
///
/// WAV files use the RIFF container format with WAVE chunks:
/// - **RIFF header**: File identification and size information
/// - **fmt chunk**: Audio format parameters (sample rate, channels, bit depth)
/// - **data chunk**: Raw PCM audio samples in little-endian format
/// - **Optional chunks**: May contain additional metadata (ignored by decoder)
///
/// # Sample Format Support
///
/// The decoder handles various PCM formats seamlessly:
/// - **8-bit integer**: Unsigned values (0-255) converted to signed range
/// - **16-bit integer**: Standard CD-quality signed samples
/// - **24-bit integer**: High-resolution audio packed in 32-bit containers
/// - **32-bit integer**: Maximum precision integer samples
/// - **32-bit float**: IEEE 754 floating-point samples (-1.0 to +1.0 range)
///
/// # Performance Characteristics
///
/// - **Header-based duration**: No file scanning required (instant calculation)
/// - **Direct random access**: O(1) seeking via hound's seek functionality
/// - **Optimized sample conversion**: Efficient bit depth handling
/// - **Minimal memory overhead**: Iterator-based sample access
/// - **Zero decompression**: Direct PCM data access
///
/// # Seeking Behavior
///
/// - **Random access seeking**: Direct positioning via hound's seek API
/// - **Forward seeking**: Linear sample skipping when not seekable
/// - **Beyond end**: Seeking past file end is clamped to actual length
/// - **Channel preservation**: Maintains correct channel order across seeks
/// - **Sample accuracy**: Precise positioning without approximation
///
/// # Generic Parameters
///
/// * `R` - The underlying data source type, must implement `Read + Seek`
