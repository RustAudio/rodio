//! # Usage
//!
//! There are two main concepts in this library:
//!
//! - Sources, represented with the `Source` trait, that provide sound data.
//! - Sinks, which accept sound data.
//!
//! In order to play a sound, you need to create a source, a sink, and connect the two. For example
//! here is how you play a sound file:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io::BufReader;
//! 
//! let endpoint = rodio::get_default_endpoint().unwrap();
//! let sink = rodio::Sink::new(&endpoint);
//! 
//! let file = std::fs::File::open("music.ogg").unwrap();
//! let source = rodio::Decoder::new(BufReader::new(file));
//! sink.append(source);
//! ```
//!
//! The `append` method takes ownership of the source and starts playing it. If a sink is already
//! playing a sound when you call `append`, the sound is added to a queue and will start playing
//! when the existing source is over.
//!
//! If you want to play multiple sounds simultaneously, you should create multiple sinks.
//!
//! # How it works
//! 
//! Rodio spawns a background thread that is dedicated to reading from the sources and sending
//! the output to the endpoint.
//! 
//! All the sounds are mixed together by rodio before being sent. Since this is handled by the
//! software, there is no restriction for the number of sinks that can be created.
//! 
//! # Adding effects
//! 
//! The `Source` trait provides various filters, similarly to the standard `Iterator` trait.
//! 
//! Example:
//! 
//! ```ignore
//! use rodio::Source;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! 
//! // repeats the first five seconds of this sound forever
//! let source = source.take_duration(Duration::from_secs(5)).repeat_infinite();
//! ```
